# HorseTP
 The HorseTP Plugin allows players to seamlessly teleport while riding a horse, enhancing the gameplay experience by ensuring that both the player and their horse are teleported together. This plugin is perfect for survival servers where players frequently move between locations and want to bring their trusted steed along for the journey.
